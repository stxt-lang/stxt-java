## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2]

- First release published to Maven Central, as `dev.stxt:stxt-core`. The artifact was
  `dev.stxt:stxt-parser:0.1.0` while it was only built locally; the name now mirrors the npm package
  `@stxt-lang/core`, and the version is aligned with it so that the same number means the same
  behaviour in both implementations.
- The published jar carries **no runtime dependencies**: Jackson and JUnit are test-scoped. It targets
  **Java 17** and declares the automatic module name `dev.stxt`.
- The conformance review against the STXT specs (`stxt-web`, versions 0.4.3 to 0.5.1) is closed: this
  parser and `@stxt-lang/core` agree on syntax, schemas, templates, value types and error codes. The
  test suite includes the real `stxt-web` corpus, so a divergence from the normative documents breaks
  the build.
- No parser, schema or template behaviour changed in this release; it is a packaging milestone.
